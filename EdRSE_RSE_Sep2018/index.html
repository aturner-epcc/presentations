		<h2>What is an RSE?</h2>
	</section>

	<section>
		<p>
		Many people in research organizations around the world combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people often lack a formal career path, particularly in the academic system. There is no easy way to recognise their contributions, reward them, or represent their views.

		<h3>Why RSE movement?</h3>

		<ul style="font-size: 0.75em">
			<li class="fragment">RSEs are critical to research but their role is not generally recognised (particularly in academia)</li>
			<li class="fragment">Career evaluation structures need to be changed to match RSE careers better (e.g. not just publication-based)</li>
			<li class="fragment">Appropriate career progression structures need to be put in place - should be support for technical advancement, not just managerial</li>
			<li class="fragment">Recognise value of research software and its development on a par with research outputs</li>
			<li class="fragment">Demonstrate the importance of RSEs to researchers, institutions and funders</li>
